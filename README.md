# Arduino library for MERG CBUS running over CAN bus, using the SAM3X8E processor on the Arduino Due

A library that implements the abstract CBUS base class. It contains methods to support the SAM3X8E CAN controller peripherals

Note that this library depends on a number of other libraries which must also be downloaded and included in the sketch:

CBUS 			- abstract CBUS base class
CBUSswitch
CBUSLED
CBUSconfig
Streaming		- C++ style output

## Hardware

Supports the SAM3X8E CAN controller peripherals. An separate 3.3V CAN transceiver is required.
